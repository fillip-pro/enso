**Ēostre** is the [Malline](https://github.com/Naamio/malline) stencil set for Fillip.pro.
It includes the stencils, **Docker** configuration, **Kubernetes** configuration,
images, scripts (TypeScript), and CSS.

## Goals

**Ēostre** is intend to be a simple web application encompassing best practices and
utilizing several preferred tools, including:

 - Pure CSS over pre-processors.
 - TypeScript, transpiled via the lightweight Webpack configuration.
 - HTML 5.1 semantic markup, and standards compliant extensions.
 - Web Components.

Additionally, it is envisaged that it will always be deployed via **Docker** / **Kubernetes**.

## Origin

After a single day writing the original web application for Fillip.pro, 
(called Lehti), progress stagnated as other projects took precidence. **Ēostre** 
is the designated replacement for Lehti as an attempt to restart and refresh 
the domain with up-to-date and relevant content.
