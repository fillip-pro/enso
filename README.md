**Ēostre** is the [Malline](https://github.com/Naamio/malline) stencil set for Fillip.pro.
It includes the stencils, **Docker** configuration, **Kubernetes** configuration,
images, scripts (TypeScript), and CSS.

## Origin

After a single day writing the original web application for Fillip.pro, 
(called Lehti), progress stagnated as other projects took precidence. **Ēostre** 
is the designated replacement for Lehti as an attempt to restart and refresh 
the domain with up-to-date and relevant content.
